# Openai-Markdown-reader
The purpose of this project is to create a specialized tool based on OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 model, designed specifically for interpreting document content and information. Unlike traditional chat interfaces, this plugin features a dedicated user interface that allows users to directly input Markdown files. Through the use of built-in commands and code, the plugin enables ChatGPT to automatically parse the document, providing insights and translations as output. This solution streamlines the process of extracting valuable information from documents and enables users to access AI-generated insights with ease.
